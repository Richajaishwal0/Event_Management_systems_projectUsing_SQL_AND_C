# Event Management System

## Project Overview
The **Event Management System** is a simple application built as a class project. The system allows users to create and manage events, register participants, and track attendance. The project is implemented using C programming for the back-end logic and MySQL for the database.

## Features
- **User Management**: Add and manage users with different roles (Organizers and Participants).
- **Event Creation**: Organizers can create and manage events, including event title, date, time, and location.
- **Event Registration**: Participants can register for events.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Track participant attendance for events.
- **User Authentication**: Manage user passwords for secure login.

## Database Schema
The system uses a MySQL database with the following tables:

1. **Users**
   - `UserID` (Primary Key)
   - `Name`
   - `Email`
   - `Role` (Organizer/Participant)

2. **Events**
   - `EventID` (Primary Key)
   - `Title`
   - `Date`
   - `Time`
   - `Location`

3. **Registrations**
   - `RegistrationID` (Primary Key)
   - `UserID` (Foreign Key)
   - `EventID` (Foreign Key)

4. **Attendance**
   - `AttendanceID` (Primary Key)
   - `UserID` (Foreign Key)
   - `EventID` (Foreign Key)

5. **Passwords**
   - `UserID` (Primary Key)
   - `Password` (Encrypted)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed.
- **MySQL Server**: Install and configure MySQL server.
- **MySQL Connector/C**: Required to connect C programs with MySQL databases.

## Setup and Installation

### MySQL Server Setup
1. **Install MySQL Server**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install mysql-server
   ```
2. **Secure MySQL Installation**:
   ```sh
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```
3. **Create DATABASE**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE Event_management;
   ```

### MySQL Connector/C Setup
4. **Install MySQL Connector/C**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
   ```

### Project Setup
5. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TheShyamTripathi/Event_Management_systems_projectUsing_SQL_AND_C/
   ```
6. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd event-management-system
   ```
7. **Compile the program**:
   ```sh
   gcc -o event_management main.c -lmysqlclient
   ```
8. **Run the Program**:
   ```sh
   ./event_management
   ```

## Sample Commands

Below are some example commands used in the system:

### Add User:
```c
add_user("John Doe", "john@example.com", "Organizer");
```
### Create Event:
```c
create_event("Tech Conference", "2024-09-15", "10:00 AM", "Auditorium");
```
### Register for Event:
```c
register_for_event(2, 5); // UserID = 2, EventID = 5
```
### Mark Attendance:
```c
mark_attendance(2, 5); // UserID = 2, EventID = 5
```
### Set User Password:
```c
set_user_password(2, "securePassword123"); // UserID = 2
```

## Usage
### Add Users:
- Organizers and participants can be added to the system.

### Create Events:
- Organizers can create events by providing details like title, date, time, and location.

### Register for Events:
- Participants can browse available events and register for them.

### Track Attendance:
- The system allows attendance marking for participants who attend events.

### User Authentication:
- Users can set and update their passwords for secure access.
